                <p>
                    Myself and my wife deccided to travel the world together one city at a time after our marriage. We started doing that and been to a couple of countries such as Maldives, Switzerland, Thailand, Prague, Vienna and many others. However, the last trip we had was to Japan, and have been traveling back to it often. We found out many amazing things that Japan has to offer which were not known by many, even those who has been to it before. We decided together to make this website which can help you explore what Japan has to offer.
